## Overview
WhiteFAANG demonstrates adversarial scenarios of data exploitation based on user exports from Apple, Google, and Meta. The POCs utilize various input files exported from the respective services, which can be found in the following links:  
  
Apple: https://support.apple.com/en-us/102208  
Google: https://takeout.google.com  
Meta: https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/accounts/privacy-information-and-settings/view-your-information-and-download-your-information

## Usage
Once you export your personal data to your laptop, replace the placeholder values with the full path of the export.  
Use `pip install` to install any required modules when necessary.   
Run the relevant code segment of the Jupyter Notebook.  
The output demonstrates the expected format but contains randomized information (MAC addr, etc.)
